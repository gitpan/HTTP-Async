  * moved polite.t test into t/ so that it gets run by the makefile.

0.08 2007/09/12

    under certain proxy configs.

  * Added proper handling of 304 responses based on code patch and test by
    Tomohiro Ikebe from livedoor.jp

  * Changed the request uri that is used so that it has the host in for proxy

0.03 2006/09/27

  * Created HTTP::Async::Polite that adds limits to the scraping to avoid over
    stretching the domain being scraped.

  * Increased the delay in poll-interval tests to stop them failing on slow
    machines.

  * Added pod tests, README and Makefile.PL in an attempt to achieve kwalitee.

0.02 2006/09/06

  * Changed the timeout to be an inactivity timeout and added a
    max_request_length to limit the amount of time that a request can be
    running for.

  * Added more diagnostics to the tests to try to find the bug that is causing
    MIYAGAWA issues.

  * Created TODO and CHANGES docs.

  * Added error checking to catch connections that fail before the headers are
    sent. (patch submitted by Egor Egorov)

  * Added ability to specify proxy to use. (based on patch from Egor Egorov)

  * Added 'add_with_opts' method that lets you override the default options
    for this request.

0.01 2006/08/21
